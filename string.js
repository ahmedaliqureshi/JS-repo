// in this file we are going to see how to declare the string and what are the different ways to show string 

// 1st method:- is by the use of ("") i.e double quotation

console.log("we can declare the text in JS with double quotation");

// 2nd method: is by the use of ('') i.e single quotation

console.log('we can declare the text in JS with single quoation as well'); 

// adding the semi colon at the end of the code is good practice
