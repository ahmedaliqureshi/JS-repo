// variable are kind of container,in which you can keep values in it and take it, and they are declared by the let keyword

// when the variable is decalred it should be follwed by the equal (assaignment operator) to vlaue or string 

let numb='number'; 

//to print the vlaues which is stored in the variable, just write the consoel log then follow it up with the name of the variable

console.log(numb);

// the value of the variable can be changed later on as well, but it won't be needing let keyword to decalre it

console.log('text stored in the variable was number');

numb='number2'; 

console.log(numb);

console.log('\t the text stored in the same variable is number2');

// the if we store number instead of the text, then that is called constant, and constent has another key word for it, and constent should be given a name as well, similar to variable but it only deals with numbers

const age= 10; 
console.log('the const cannot be change once it is declared and it should be given name as well')
console.log(age);
